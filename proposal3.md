# Bayesian vs Machine Learning Classification Comparison 

### Sabrina Pereira and Ashley Swanson

---

We plan to explore the differences between the classification outcomes of machine learning classifiers and naive Bayesian classifiers. Specifically, we are curious if the misclassified data points are similar between the two methods, implying that they are truly indistinguishable based on the given traits, or if the classifiers get different data points wrong, implying differences in modeling. To do this, we plan to implement machine learning to output roughly the same precision and recall as a naive Bayesian classifier and analyze the similarities and differences of misclassified data points.

We plan to begin with the Iris dataset that comes pre-loaded in scikit learn. This will allow us to begin classifying immediately after some cleaning. We recognize that the results of this test will only extend to this dataset, so a possible extension would be to redo the process with another set and see if the results align. 

The Iris data was originally collected by Edgar Anderson in 1935, and used in R. A. Fisherâ€™s paper The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems (link to original paper with the data: http://rcs.chemometrics.ru/Tutorials/classification/Fisher.pdf), and we will make sure to credit them appropriately. We could find no specific Terms of Use, likely because it is an older, relatively simple and widely used dataset in this field.

One ethical concern is that we ensure that we do not state/make it seem that one method is better than the other - we are not experts in either and cannot make that claim.
